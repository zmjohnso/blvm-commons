//! Vote Aggregator
//!
//! Aggregates votes from maintainers for governance proposals.
//! Governance is maintainer-only multisig.
//! Zap votes are tracked for transparency/reporting but do NOT affect governance decisions.
//! Maintainer signatures come from the database (populated by webhooks from GitHub PR reviews).
