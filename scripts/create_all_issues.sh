    "Improve error messages" \
    "## Description

Make consensus validation error messages more descriptive and helpful.

## Context

Clear error messages help developers understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Our consensus validation errors could be more descriptive.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Review existing error messages in consensus validation
- [ ] Improve error messages to be more descriptive
- [ ] Add context about what validation failed
- [ ] Ensure error messages are user-friendly

## Technical Details

- **Files to modify**: \`src/**/*.rs\`
- **Dependencies**: None
- **References**: See existing error types

## Skills Required

- Rust
- UX design
- Error handling

## Difficulty

- [x] Good First Issue
- [ ] Intermediate
- [ ] Advanced

## Priority

- [ ] P0 (Critical - Blocks production)
- [ ] P1 (High - Important feature)
- [ ] P2 (Medium - Nice to have)
- [x] P3 (Low - Future enhancement)

## Getting Started

1. Search for error messages in consensus code
2. Identify messages that could be clearer
3. Improve error messages with more context
4. Test error messages appear correctly
5. Submit PR with improvements" \

    "Implement missing spec-lock verification" \
    "## Description

Add formal verification for uncovered consensus rules using blvm-spec-lock.

## Context

blvm-spec-lock provides formal verification linking code to Orange Paper specifications. There may be consensus rules that could benefit from additional \`#[spec_locked]\` annotations and verification.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Identify consensus rules without spec-lock verification
- [ ] Add \`#[spec_locked]\` annotations for identified rules
- [ ] Verify: \`cargo spec-lock verify --crate-path .\`
- [ ] Document the verified functions

## Technical Details

- **Files to modify**: \`src/**/*.rs\` (add \`#[spec_locked(\"section\")]\` attributes)
- **Dependencies**: blvm-spec-lock (see blvm-consensus docs)
